Chrome Platform Analytics is a Javascript library supporting the use of Google Analytics (GA) from Chrome Platform Applications (and Extensions).
####

This fork addresses 2 problems:
- bower.json file 
- bundle script is manually wrapped into ChromeAnalytics module. So you use ChromeAnalytics variable instead of analytics. 

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-platform-analytics/wiki) for more information.
